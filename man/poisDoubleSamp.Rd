\title{poisDoubleSamp : Confidence intervals with Poisson double sampling}
\description{
Functions to create confidence intervals for ratios of Poisson rates under
misclassification using double sampling. Implementations of the methods
described in Kahle, D., P. Young, B. Greer, and D. Young (2016). "Confidence
Intervals for the Ratio of Two Poisson Rates Under One-Way Differential
Misclassification Using Double Sampling." Computational Statistics & Data
Analysis, 95:122â€“132.
